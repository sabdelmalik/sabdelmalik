I’m interested in programming in general. I mainly code in c#, but also in c, c++, Java and JavaScript.<br>
I'm also interested in programming microcontrollers (which I used to program in assembly languages) and designing/building circuits around them.<br><br>
I completed tagging the Smith and Van Dyke Arabic Bible with Strong's numbers which can be viewed 
[here](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=AraSVD|version=ESV|version=OHB|reference=Ps.8&options=VNH&display=INTERLEAVED).<br>
I'm currently working on translating BDB lexicon to Arabic.<br>
