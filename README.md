I’m interested in programming in general. I mainly code in c#, but also in c, c++, Java and JavaScript.<br>
I'm also interested in programming microcontrollers (which I used to program in assembly languages) and designing/building circuits around them.<br><br>
I completed tagging the Smith and Van Dyke Arabic Bible with Strong's numbers which can be viewed 
[here](https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=AraSVD|version=ESV|version=OHB|reference=Ps.8&options=VNH&display=INTERLEAVED).<br>
A publicly available version under CC-BY-SA license can be found [here](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/tree/master/Tagged-Bibles/Arabic%20Bibles). It is in [OSIS](https://crosswire.org/osis/) xml format.<br><br>
"Translation Tags (TT)" files can also be found in the same folder. The OT file contains details about the Hebrew/Aramaic underlying each translated word in Smith & Van Dyck translation. The NT file contains similar information but for Greek. A subfolder contains a TT file for each Bible book individually<br><br>

I'm also, with the help of others, working on translating BDB lexicon to Arabic. <br><br>
